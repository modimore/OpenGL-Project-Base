# *OpenGL Project Base*

Either some software update or some thing I manually did somewhere broke all of my Advanced Computer Graphics homeworks, but I generally liked them so I figured I could replace the similar parts of their codebases rather than fix all the individual assignments separately.

This code is similar in functionality, and in many places in structure, to code written by my ACG professor Barbara Cutler. The "Camera.hpp" and "Camera.cpp" files remain largely unchanged from Professor Cutler's versions.
